WORKING TITLE

In npgrpg, the world creates itself from the inside out, starting with just a single room and the player, and expanding outward as randomly generated characters carry out their actions according to their aspirations and affiliations. Each time a character (PC or NPC) enter a tile that has not been generated yet, that tile and all of its features are randomized, according to a gradient of biomes, and placed upon the explorable map.

Each of the following lists, as well as the above description, shall be updated as the project passes further into fruition.

TODO:
-Nation Mapper(parse over existing groups and band those of similar aspirations together into organizations and nations...pass this information to npgrpg global lists.)
-Terrain Revisor(parse over existing biomes, make note of borders between different types and smooth them out by adding transition biomes.)
-Climate Mapper(parse over existing biomes, create map of climate based off of prospective airflow, etc. due to different temperatures and geological features)
